			All roads lead to glory,
			<br>to one of quizzes, three.
			<br>Upon the top your name might show
			<br>if clever, you can be.
			<br><br>
			<br>The first will test your luck,
			<br>from crying you’ll refrain.
			<br>To find it look upon the screen
			<br>and tell me the Doc’s name.
			<br><br>
			<br>The second is a simple lot
			<br>Quite easy to contrive
			<br>to play it isn't difficult
			<br>just five and seven and five.
			<br><br>
			<br>The third is opened in front,
			<br>littered, full, with fables
			<br>but will this help to get you there?
			<br>For that you'll need Green Gables.
			<br><br>
			<br>And if you are sharp-witted
			<br>or find yourself behind,
			<br>for you there are some extra points
			<br>a bonus you can find.
